        <h2>What’s the secret to getting farmers hooked on agtech apps?</h2>
        <h5>August 18, 2019</h5>
        <h5><i>Joe Gan</i></h5>
        <p>Keeping an app’s user interface sticky means making sure users come back regularly. For app-based startups, it’s an important factor in seizing opportunities to monetize and innovate. There’s no “one size fits all” approach, of course; strategies must be customized for a target audience.</p>
        <p>
            So what app features keep farmers in rural areas whipping out their phones daily and buying into startups’ products and services? AFN spoke to agtech app designers building products for Asia’s developing markets at the World Economic Forum-established Grow Asia panel on August 15, hosted as part of a digital learning series. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For Myanmar-based Impact Terra, the key is building digital services that farmers “can do something with and extract value,” says founder and CEO Erwin Sikma. “We need to provide higher value, to give something more valuable than what’s available.”  
        </p>
        <p>
            Impact Terra is an agtech startup with a social mission to boost Myanmar’s smallholder farmers’ productivity, and therefore livelihoods. It raised nearly $3 million in grant funding in March for its mobile and web-based app called Golden Paddy that offers farmers crop and weather information, advice, access to market services and financing.
        </p>
        <p>
            One trend working in Impact Terra’s favor is Myanmar’s meteoric rise to mobile connectivity. When the country emerged from decades of isolation imposed by military dictatorship in 2011, only North Korea had fewer mobile phones. Today, 80% of Myanmar’s 53-million-strong population owns a smartphone, including 70% of farmers. 
        </p>
        <p>
            But despite Myanmar’s high mobile penetration rate, encouraging users to download and use its app has been challenging for Impact Terra, whose Golden Paddy app reaches three million monthly unique people. “There needs to be a low barrier to usage and in Myanmar. The GooglePlay store is not being used, and farmers are not updating their apps regularly,” says Sikma. 
        </p>
        <p>
            One thing that remains important to Impact Terra’s users: human interaction. The company strives to be responsive to that, says Sikma. “This doesn’t mean we have our people meeting farmers face-to-face all the time,” he explains, but the company recognizes that it is key to building trust with users.

            Tapping untapped youth potential
        </p>
        <p>
            Indonesian e-commerce platform TaniHub, which connects rural farmers to customers, takes a different approach to enhancing its product’s stickiness: it taps into Millennials’ tech habits–specifically, how inseparable they are from their phones and how quickly they pick up new tech. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Like Myanmar, Indonesia has a substantial number of active internet users–nearly 65% by one study’s estimates. That figure is set to rise.
        </p>
        <p>
            “The low-hanging fruit is the youngsters,” says Sariyo, TaniHub’s head of business development, who goes by one name. “Youngsters are more curious, and they want to have a quick win, as well as easy and fast access.”
        </p>
        <p>
            TaniHub is among a crop of startups benefitting from a mini agtech funding frenzy in Asia. Its parent company, agribusiness marketplace and fintech platform TaniGroup closed $10 million Series A funding round led by Singapore-based Openspace Ventures in May. Since then, TaniHub has recruited roughly 30,000 to its platform and is eyeing broader expansion across Indonesia with the new injection of capital.
        </p>
        <p>
            “We sort of forced [young people] to spread the word to friends by giving them incentives,” Sariyo jokes. 
        </p>
        <p>
            But its incentives are highly targeted because to build its user base, TaniHub relies largely on word-of-mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Mass influence is very difficult art, and we aren’t going there. We aren’t going to gather all farmers in one village and then force them to work with us,” says Sariyo. “We are using the champion approach, where we work with one or two top farmers. And when it works, they spread the word about us by telling their friends.” 
        </p>
        <p>
            If there was a key takeaway from the event, it was that whatever a company’s core offering, adoption depends on user experience and enabling users to recognize value. Without that, retention, or stickiness, will suffer, as will growth.

        <h2>Farming is the world’s most important career — that’s why it needs a new image</h2>
        <h5>August 26, 2019,  Karn Manhas</h5>
        <p>
            Editor’s Note: Karn Manhas is founder and CEO of Terramera, an agbiotech startup focused on improving the sustainability of farming. Here he writes about the importance of promoting the farming industry as an appealing and impactful career for the next generation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Back in 1870, almost half the U.S. workforce was employed in agriculture — today just two percent of Americans work on farms. Over the decades, some people were driven away by mechanization, lured to cities by the promise of better paying jobs. More recently, trade wars, tariffs, volatile crop prices and declining profit margins have increased risk for farmers — and then there’s the impact of climate change on crop yields, chronic labor shortages and increasing debt. Add to that the perception of farming as unsophisticated, undesirable work and it’s no wonder family farms, once the backbone of America, are now in crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to the 2017 USDA census, the average American farmer is 57 years old and with few young people entering the field, farming is in desperate need of new blood. There’s much more than centuries of tradition at stake. The UN estimates that the world population will reach 8.5 billion by 2030, and as high as 9.8 billion by 2050, requiring a 70 percent increase in global food production. With that many mouths to feed, farming may well be the most important job on the planet.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the CEO of an AgTech company working to help farms transition to more sustainable practices, I’ve seen firsthand the effort and dedication farmers put into stewarding the land and feeding the world. I’ve also seen misperception about what farming is (and isn’t) hold the sector back from attracting younger generations and adopting technological innovations that can improve the lives and livelihoods of farmers. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It seems to me that what’s needed is a rebrand of sorts — a concerted effort to separate myth from fact and promote the potential farming holds for fulfilling, impactful careers. So, how do we give agriculture an image makeover? I don’t have all the answers, but I do have a few ideas on where to start.
        </p>
        <p>
            Farming is a Tech Industry — Let’s Treat it Like One
        </p>
        <p>
            Twenty years ago, it wasn’t cool to work at a car company, but today companies like Tesla are attracting some of our best and brightest by reframing auto manufacturing as a sophisticated, futuristic field. Farming has the potential to do the same.
        </p>
        <p>
            Agriculture might be perceived as old-fashioned and low-tech, but farmers have worked hand-in-hand with technology for generations — whether it’s large machines like tractors and combines or complex chemicals, fertilizers and pesticides. Right now the field is in the midst of profound change as advanced technologies including green chemistries, robotics, artificial intelligence, IoT, autonomous vehicles,machine learning, regenerative agriculture and biomimetics transform how farms look and function. It might seem like the stuff of science fiction, but autonomous vehicles, indoor farming and drone pollination are becoming more common throughout the sector.
        </p>
        <p>
            Looking at, and more importantly, talking about farming as a part of the tech revolution has the potential to ignite the curiosity and imagination of the next generation. In fact, it’s already happening in many countries in Africa, where millennials are using apps and other inexpensive technologies to improve profits and elevate the image of farmers from peasants to professionals. North America would do well to follow suit with an updated image of farmers wielding smartphones rather than American Gothic-era pitchforks.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Create Better Economics — and Education — for Farmers
        </p>
        <p>
            Advanced technologies may be poised to revolutionize farming, but the reality is they don’t come cheap — at least not yet.  Most farmers don’t have the budget for a strawberry-picking robot much less the skillset to maintain or repair one. What’s needed is an industry-wide, gradual integration of affordable AgTech, accompanied by education and mentorship. Traditional farming co-ops could be revitalized to help bring farming into the digital age by pooling funds and sharing resources to offset the cost of emerging technologies — while still providing vital networks for knowledge sharing and a sense of community.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meanwhile, farming knowledge, once passed down from generation to generation, needs to include people who weren’t necessarily raised on farms. Programs like Square Roots and New Entry are starting this wave with courses like plant science, indoor farming and business foundations that aim to teach next-generation farming skills to a new generation and lineage of farmers. Right now farmers can test and iterate on a crop season maybe 50 times in their life. New tools will allow them to experiment optimize much more rapidly. Startups like Prospera, Iron Ox and Farmer’s Edge are utilizing sensors, analytics and machine learning to capture the interest of younger generations and improve predictability, precision and profits. My own company is working to reduce reliance on synthetic chemical fertilizers and pesticides while increasing yields by gathering data on how inputs like crop protection products, nutrients and water can be used smarter to naturally boost a plant’s resistance to pests, disease and drought. By augmenting farmers’ intuition with informed cause and effect we can use technology to take the guesswork out farming and decrease risk.

            Deepen Our Connection with Food
        </p>
        <p>
            There’s something special about the gift of food. If someone takes the time to bake you a pie, it’s a gift from the heart. If someone bakes you a pie made with strawberries and rhubarb that they grew themselves? Now that’s a whole new level of love.
        </p>
        <p>
            From food bloggers posting plates on Instagram to the explosion of TV shows exploring everything from street food to obscure ingredients, foodie culture has deepened our appreciation of good food. But there’s still a disconnect with how it’s grown, or more importantly, who grew it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Fortunately, we’re headed in the right direction. The increasing popularity of plant-based products such as Beyond Meat and the skyrocketing demand for organic, natural and local produce has people asking what’s in their food. The next step is to connect the dots with how it’s grown.
        </p>
        <p>
            Education of this sort needs to start at a young age, with school community garden projects and field trips to farms. The Clinton Foundation’s Students for Eco-Education and Agriculture program provides a hands-on agricultural literacy that helps kids understand the food journey – from farm to table – and teaches them about healthy eating, sustainable farming practices and the fragility of our ecosystem. Michelle Obama’s White House Kitchen Garden, meanwhile, sparked a nationwide conversation about nutrition and exposed a generation of kids to the joys of growing their own food. We need to build on that legacy. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Emphasize the Purpose of Farming 
        </p>
        <p>
            We’ve heard time and again that millennials want meaningful careers that help make the world a better place. Often that interest is funnelled towards jobs in CleanTech, non-profits, the environment or the arts. But farming is an overlooked industry with incredible potential to help improve the world. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Farmers are stewards of the land, with huge potential to restore damaged ecosystems by employing sustainable and regenerative agricultural practices. As the world grapples with the effects of climate change, the next generation of farmers has a pivotal role to play in correcting the mistakes of the past. Companies like Ingleby Farms have tapped into this ethos by promoting their focus on long-term care of the land, green energy and biodiversity. They’re walking the talk, providing food with a conscience and farms with a future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Somewhere along the line we started to devalue farmers and take them for granted, but it’s hard to think of a career that’s more important for our collective survival. Feeding the planet isn’t simplistic or base, it’s multifaceted, complex and sophisticated. Farmers are the original experimenters, hackers, makers and problem-solvers; they’re biologists, chemists, engineers, entrepreneurs and inventors. Perhaps if we talked about them like that, young people would be inspired to continue their legacy, and proudly bring the field into the future.
