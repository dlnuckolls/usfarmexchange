     <h1>UNDERSTANDING CROP INSURANCE</h1>
        <hr />
        <hr />
         <p>The government has entered into a partnership with private Crop Insurance providers to offer Crop Insurance on an equal-opportunity basis to agricultural producers nationwide. Approved insurance providers (AIPs) use independent licensed agents to market this insurance.</p>
         <p>Every year approved insurance providers (AIPs) enter into a contract called the Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA) with the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) to administer the Crop Insurance program by marketing, underwriting, and adjusting claims for Crop Insurance policies. The insurance providers transmit data to the Federal government. They are also responsible for both the training and monitoring of agents and staff.</p>
        <p>Premium rates and insurance terms and conditions are established by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) for the products it develops. There are also products developed by insurance providers and established with FCIC approval. In both cases, the price of insurance is constant throughout the industry. In other words, the cost is the same regardless of the Crop Insurance company or agency. Companies and agencies compete with Crop Insurance knowledge, customer service, and related insurance products. The agent’s ability to build business relationships with the insured is an important piece of the delivery system.</p>
<p>Crop insurance is purchased by agricultural producers, including farmers, ranchers and others to protect against either their loss of their crops due to natural disasters, or the loss of revenue due to declines in the prices of agricultural commodities.</p>
There are two major types of crop insurance:
        <ol>
            <li>Multiple Peril Crop Insurance (MPCI)</li>
            <li>Crop-Hail Insurance</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>MULTIPLE PERIL CROP INSURANCE (MPCI)</h3>
        <hr />
       <p> MPCI covers crop losses, including lower yields, caused by natural events, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Destructive weather (Hail, Frost, Damaging Wind)</li>
            <li>Disease</li>
            <li>Drought</li>
            <li>Fire</li>
            <li>Flooding Insect Damage</li>
        </ul>
<p>MPCI is federally supported and regulated, and is sold and serviced by private-sector crop insurance companies and agents.</p>
<p>More than 90% of farmers who buy crop insurance opt for MPCI. Both the cost of insurance and the amount and insurer will pay for losses are tied to the value of the specific crop. MPCI is available for more than 120 different crops, though not all crops are covered in every geographical area. </p>
<p>MPCI policies must be purchased each growing season by deadlines established by the federal government – and before a crop is planted. If damage occurs early enough in the growing season, the policy may include incentives to replant – or penalties for not doing so.</p>
        <h3>CROP- HAIL INSURANCE</h3>
            <hr />
<p> In areas of the country where hail is a frequent event, farmers often purchase crop-hail policies to protect high-yielding crops. These policies are not part of the Federal Crop Insurance Program. They are sold by private insurers and regulated by state insurance departments. Many farmers purchase crop-hail coverage as a supplement to MPCI. Crop-Hail policies often have a low or even no deductible. Because, unlike drought or blight, hail can completely destroy a portion of crops in one area of a farm but leave other crops undamaged, a hail claim may be less than the amount of the deductible on an MPCI policy.</p>
<p>Due to its limitations, this insurance is purchased much less frequently than MPCI. Unlike MPCI, crop-hail insurance can be purchased at any point in the growing season. </p>
        <h3>CROP REVENUE INSURANCE</h3>
            <hr />
<p> Farmers can also purchase crop revenue insurance, which helps farmers in years when crops have a low yield and/or the price of the crop is low. The amount that an insurer will pay reflects how much lower a year’s revenues are compared to previous years’ earnings. This insurance helps farmers protect their earnings against drastic swings in crop prices, regardless of the cause. </p>

        <h1>CROP INSURANCE CYCLE</h1>
        <hr />
        <hr />
        <img src="../images/Crop-Insurance-Cycle.png" />
        <h3>APPLICATION PROCESS</h3>
        <hr />
        <p><b> 1.    Policy Renewal, Change Options, Application</b></p>
<p>The Insurance Cycle begins each year with the insurance offer. Actuarial documents are published annually by the Risk Management Agency (RMA). The actuarial documents list the plan of insurance, crop, type, variety, and practice that may be insured in a state and county, and show the amounts of insurance, available insurance options, levels of coverage, price elections, applicable premium rates, and subsidy amounts. The Special Provisions of Insurance list program calendar dates, and general and special statements which may further define, limit, or modify coverage.</p>
<p><b>2.    Sales Closing, Cancellation, Termination Dates</b></p>
<p>Insurance applications must be completed and signed no later than the sales closing date specified in the crop actuarial documents. Applications signed after the crop sales closing date may be rejected by the insurance provider.</p>
<p>Insurance coverage is continuous and can be cancelled by either the insurance provider or the policyholder for the following crop year by providing a written notice to the other party no later than the cancellation date specified in the crop policy. For a policyholder insured the previous crop year, any changes he or she wishes to make to the policy coverage must be made on or before the crop sales closing date. The policy will automatically renew for the subsequent crop year unless the policyholder cancels the policy in writing on or before the crop cancellation date.</p>
<p>Insurance coverage may be terminated by the insurance provider for the following crop year for nonpayment of outstanding debt by providing a written notice to the policyholder no later than the termination date specified in the crop policy. The insurance provider may terminate coverage on a crop if no premium is earned for three consecutive years.</p>
<p><b>3.    Acceptance</b></p>
Upon receipt of a properly completed and timely submitted insurance application, the insurance provider will accept and process the application, unless the applicant is determined to be ineligible under the contract or Federal statute or regulation. The insurance provider will issue a summary of coverage and the appropriate policy documents to the applicant. After the application is accepted, the policyholder may not cancel the policy for the initial crop year. 
<p><b>4.    Insurance Attaches</b></p>
<p>For annual crops, insurance attaches annually when planting begins on the insurance unit. The crop must be planted on or before the crop's published final planting date unless late or prevented planting provisions apply. If prevented planting provisions apply, and the crop cannot be timely planted due to the causes specified in the crop provisions, such acreage may be eligible for a prevented planting payment.</p>
<p>For perennial crops, insurance attaches each crop year on the calendar date specified in the crop provisions</p>
        <h3>COVERAGE AND BILLING</h3>
        <hr />
<p><b> 5.    Acreage Reports</b></p>
<p>The policyholder must annually report for each insured crop in the county the number of insurable and uninsurable acres planted or prevented from being planted if prevented planting is available for the crop, the date the acreage was planted, share in the crop, the acreage location, farming practices used, and types or varieties planted to the insurance provider on or before the applicable acreage reporting. This report is used by the insurance provider to establish the amount of coverage and premium for the crop. Insurance providers may deny coverage if the acreage report is filed after the applicable crop acreage reporting date.</p>
<p><b>6.    Summary of Coverage</b></p>
<p>The insurance provider will process a properly completed and timely filed acreage report, and issue to the policyholder a summary of coverage that specifies the insured crop, the insured acres and amount of insurance or guarantee for each insurance unit. The policyholder may make changes to the filed acreage report, if permitted by the insurance provider.</p>
<p><b>7.    Premium Billing</b></p>
<p>The annual premium is earned and payable at the time insurance coverage begins. The insurance provider shall issue a premium billing based upon the information contained in the acreage report no earlier than the premium billing date specified in the crop actuarial documents. The premium billing will specify the amount of premium and any administrative fees that may be due. If the premium or administrative fees are not paid by the date specified in the actuarial documents or policy, the insurance provider may assess interest on the outstanding premium balance.</p>
        <h3>CLAIMS PROCESS</h3>
        <hr />
<p><b> 8.    Notice of Damage or Loss of Production</b></p>
<p> written notice of damage or loss of production for each unit is to be filed by the policyholder within 72 hours of the policyholder's initial discovery of damage or loss of production, but not later than 15 days after the end of the insurance period unless otherwise stated in the individual crop policy. The policyholder should refer to the individual crop provisions for additional requirements in the event of damage or loss. These notifications provide the opportunity for the insurance provider to inspect the crop and determine the extent of damage or potential production before the crop is harvested or otherwise disposed of. </p>
<p><b>9.    Inspection</b></p>
<p>After the insurance provider receives the written notice of damage or loss, it will be processed and, if necessary, a loss adjuster will be sent to inspect the damaged crop and gather pertinent information concerning the damage. If the policyholder wishes to destroy or not harvest the crop, the loss adjuster will gather the appropriate information, conduct an appraisal to establish the crop's remaining value and complete any forms needed. If the crop has been harvested or will not be harvested by the end of the insurance period, and the policyholder wishes to file a claim for indemnity, the loss adjuster will gather the appropriate information and assist the policyholder in filing the claim for indemnity. It is the policyholder's responsibility to establish the time, location, cause, and amount of any loss.</p>
<p><b>10.    Indemnity Claim</b></p>
<p>After the claim for indemnity is processed by the insurance provider, an indemnity check and a summary of indemnity payment will be issued showing any deductions to the amount of indemnity for outstanding premium, interest, or administrative fees.</p>
        <h3>PROGRAM CHANGES</h3>
        <hr />
<p><b>11.    Contract Change Date</b></p>
<p>Changes to the insurance policy may be made by RMA from one year to the next. Such changes will be available on RMA's Web site not later than the contract change date contained in the applicable Crop Provisions. The insurance provider will notify the policyholder in writing of any changes to the Basic Provisions, Crop Provisions, Commodity Exchange Price Provisions, if applicable, and Special Provisions of Insurance not later than 30 days prior to the cancellation date for the insured crop. The policyholder will have the opportunity to review the changes and, if desired, continue the insurance coverage for the following crop year, change the policy coverage, or cancel the insurance coverage. Any changes to the policy coverage that the policyholder makes must be made no later than the crop sales closing date. If the policyholder wishes to cancel the policy, a written notice must be submitted to the insurance provider on or before the crop cancellation date.</p>

    <asp:Panel ID="Competition" runat="server">
        <h1>COMPETITION IN CROP INSURANCE INDUSTRY</h1>
        <hr />
        <hr />
<p>In most of the insurance industry, companies compete on the prices they charge for their products, on their product offerings and on their quality of service. Competition prevents profits from getting too high or too low. If profits are too low, premiums tend to rise. If they didn’t, companies would either go out of business or fail to meet the financial reserve requirements set by regulators. If profits are high, premiums tend to fall as companies compete to expand their customer base and new competitors enter the industry.</p>
<p>However, crop insurance companies are not like other insurance companies, because they do not compete on price or on the products they offer, and they have limited ability to compete on quality of service. The large subsidies that the federal crop insurance program provides make it impossible for purely private insurance products to compete. Farmers would have to pay more than double what they currently pay for similar insurance offered by the private sector. Instead, all crop insurance companies sell the same products at the same government-regulated price. Most policies are sold through independent agents, who are by far the most important point of contact farmers have with the crop insurance program. Because the companies are a step removed from their customers, the opportunities to offer improved service are quite limited. In fact, many farmers do not even know which company insures their crop.</p>
<p>But competition does exist in crop insurance. Companies compete for the agents’ business and for specialists such as claims adjusters, insurance underwriters and knowledgeable executives. Agents can deliver their customers to any crop insurance company that does business in the state. And being rational, agents tend to deliver their business to the company that offers them the highest commissions.</p>
<p>To see how this competition worked before a cap on agent commissions was imposed on July 2010, suppose that an agent in Iowa books of business with $1 million in premiums. The crop insurance companies know how much net revenue to expect from this amount of business. The revenue is generated from the government’s Administrative and Operating (A&O) reimbursements and by the net underwriting gain. The net underwriting gain is the amount by which the $1 million in premium is expected to exceed the claims paid out after accounting for all government-provided reinsurance program details.</p>

    <asp:Panel ID="History" runat="server">
        <h1>HISTORY OF CROP INSURANCE</h1>
        <hr />
        <hr />
<p><b>In the 1880s,</b> a group of tobacco farmers in Connecticut formed the first organized Crop Insurance company, offering protection against losses from hail. Hail coverage was offered by private companies for the next 50 years.</p>
<p><b>In 1935,</b> the dust storms began. After a year of record-breaking heat, the dusty soil from plowed fields drifted and piled up like snowdrifts, except it didn’t melt in the spring. Instead, crops and cattle died. On Feb 19, 1937, the Federal government announced the first national Crop Insurance program to help agriculture recover from the combined effects of the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl.</p>
<p><b>In 1938,</b> the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) was created to carry out the program. Initially, the program was started as an experiment. Crop Insurance activities were limited to major crops in the main producing areas. Crop Insurance remained an experiment due to high costs and low participation rates among farmers for the next 42 years until the passage of the Federal Crop Insurance ACT of 1980.</p>
<p>Up to this point, Crop Insurance was strictly a government program. In the 1980s, private insurance companies became involved and, by 1998, had become the sole providers of Crop Insurance to the American farmer.</p>
<p>Although the number of insurable crops or commodities grew with the passage of the 1980 Act, it did not achieve the level of participation that Congress had hoped for. After a major drought in 1988, “ad hoc disaster assistance” (unplanned assistance created specifically for this event) was authorized to provide relief to eligible farmers. Another ad hoc disaster bill was passed in 1989, a third in 1992, and a fourth in 1993. Congress grew tired of these repeated requests.</p>
<p><b>By the early 1990s,</b> Crop Insurance participation rates were still low, and Congress was spending more money in disaster relief than it was on Crop Insurance. This led to the enactment of the Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994 which dramatically restructured the program. This Reform act made participation in the Crop Insurance program mandatory for farmers to be eligible for deficiency payments under price support programs, certain loans, and other benefits. Because participation was mandatory, catastrophic (CAT) coverage was created.</p>
<p>CAT coverage compensated farmers for losses exceeding 50 percent of an average yield paid at 60 percent of the price established for the crop for that year. The premium for CAT coverage was completely subsidized by the Federal government. Participants paid $50 per crop per county subject to maximum amounts for multiple crops and counties insured by the same individual. Subsidies for higher coverage levels were increased.</p>
<p><b>In 1996,</b> Congress repealed the mandatory participation requirement. However, farmers who accepted other benefits were required to purchase Crop Insurance or otherwise waive eligibility for any disaster benefits that might be made available for the crop year. These provisions are still in effect.</p>
<p>In the same year, the Risk Management Agency (RMA) was created in the United States Department of Agriculture to administer the Federal Crop Insurance programs and other non-insurance-related risk management and education programs that help support U.S. agriculture. Through subsidies built into new guidelines, participation grew.</p>
<p><b>By 1998,</b> more than 180 million acres of farmland were insured under the program, representing a three-fold increase over 1988.</p>
<p><b>In 2000,</b> the Agriculture Risk Protection Act (ARPA) allowed Congress to enact legislation that expanded the role of the private sector, allowing entities to participate in conducting research and development of new insurance products and features. With the expansion of the contracting and partnering authority, RMA can enter into contracts or create partnerships for research and development of new and innovative insurance products.</p>
<p>Authority was added to allow the Board of Directors to create an expert review panel to aid the board in evaluating new insurance products for feasibility and actuarial soundness. ARPA also increased premium subsidy levels to farmers to encourage greater participation and included provisions designed to reduce fraud, waste and abuse.</p>
<p><b>In 2008,</b> more than 272 million acres were insured and by 2013, Crop Insurance protected more than 294 million acres. This was equal to 89% of planted cropland, including protecting 128 different crops with an insured value of $124 billion!</p>
<p><b>In 2014,</b> The Farm Bill substantially strengthened Crop Insurance by adding several new products and options for farmers and ranchers and by making Crop Insurance more affordable for beginning farmers with a new provision called Beginning Farmer and Rancher (BFR) Benefits.</p>
<p>The Farm Bill required a number of program revisions to reinforce Crop Insurance’s role as the primary component of the farm safety net. The major enhancement to Crop Insurance was the addition of two supplemental policies. The Supplemental Coverage Option (SCO) and the Stacked Income Protection Plan (STAX)) which help producers expand their protection against losses due to natural disasters or price declines. Another major addition was the Whole Farm Revenue Protection (WFRP) policy which provides coverage for highly diversified farms and farms selling two to five commodities to wholesale markets.</p>
<p>The Farm Bill provides for increased program integrity, guaranteeing tax dollars are used effectively and efficiently as we expand the farm safety net.</p>
<p><b>Today,</b> the Federal Government’s role in the Crop Insurance industry is to establish policy provisions, rules, and regulations. Depending on the level of coverage, the government subsidizes from 38% to 67% of the producer’s premium and provides reinsurance to Approved Insurance Providers (AIPs). The government also provides administrative and operating (A&O) reimbursement to these companies.</p>

    <asp:Panel ID="Glossary" runat="server">
        <h1>GLOSSARY</h1>
        <hr />
        <hr />
       <p style="color:firebrick" ><b>A</b></p>
<p><b>Actual Production History (APH).</b>  Actual Production History is the most common plan of insurance under the Multiple Peril Crop Insurance, or MPCI, umbrella. It is the basis for determining your guarantee under either multi-peril crop insurance or revenue insurance policies. The APH is calculated as a 4- to 10-year simple average of your actual yield on the insured land. If you do not have records of actual yields, a “transitional yield” based on average yields in your county is used. </p>
<p><b>Actuarial soundness.</b> This is an insurance term that describes a situation where indemnities paid, on average, are equal to total premiums collected.</p>
<p><b> Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000 (ARPA).</b> This law provided $8.2 billion for insurance premium subsidies and $5.2 billion for market loss assistance payments for producers. Among its other effects, ARPA also modified the crop insurance premium subsidy structure, authorized pilot programs for new forms of insurance, expanded insurance fraud detection and enforcement, and dropped the area yield loss trigger in the NAP program. </p>
<p><b>Adjusted Gross Revenue-Lite (AGR-Lite). </b> AGR-Lite is whole farm revenue insurance that covers almost all of the commodities produced on a farm. It is an individualized revenue insurance based on individual producer yields, quality, and marketing history that equals gross income.</p>
<p style="color:firebrick" ><b>B</b></p>
<p><b>Buy-up coverage.</b>  This refers to crop insurance coverage that exceeds the CAT (catastrophic) level. Coverage is available up to 75 percent of your expected yield or expected revenue (which is yield times price). In some areas, coverage up to 85 percent is available for some crops. You pay part of the premium, but government premium subsidy rates are now over 50 percent for most levels of coverage.</p>
<p style="color:firebrick" ><b>C</b></p>
<p><b>CAT coverage.</b>  CAT is short for “catastrophic,” and refers to crop insurance coverage at the lowest, or catastrophic level. CAT coverage is set at the 50/55 level, which means that your yield must fall below 50 percent of your average yield before a loss is paid. These losses are paid at a rate of 55 percent of the highest price election. You must pay an administrative fee to become eligible to receive CAT coverage, but the government pays the entire premium. </p>
<p><b>Crop Revenue Coverage (CRC).</b>  CRC is the most widely available revenue protection policy. This policy guarantees an amount of revenue (based on your actual production history (APH) x commodity price), called the final guarantee. </p>
<p><b>Crop revenue insurance.</b>  Crop revenue insurance pays you indemnities based on gross revenue shortfalls instead of just yield or price shortfalls. Types of crop revenue insurance includes Crop Revenue Coverage (CRC), Revenue Assurance (RA) and Income Protection (IP). These programs are subsidized and reinsured by the USDA’s Risk Management Agency. </p>
<p><b>Crop yield insurance.</b>  Also known as Actual Production History (APH) yield, crop yield insurance pays indemnities to producers when yields fall below the producer’s insured yield level due to most natural causes. Crop yield insurance is subsidized by the USDA’s Risk Management Agency.</p>
<p style="color:firebrick" ><b>D</b></p>
<p><b>Disaster payments.</b>  These are direct payments to farmers on an emergency basis when crop yields are abnormally low due to adverse growing conditions. During the 1970s, there was a “standing” disaster payments program, with payments made without declaration of a disaster area. Regular payments ceased after 1981, but since then ad hoc disaster payments have been specially approved by the U.S. Congress on a number of occasions.</p>
<p><b>Dollar Plan of Insurance.</b>  The Dollar Plan of Insurance lets you select one of several dollar amounts of insurance per acre prior to planting. For vegetable crops, fresh market corn, fresh market tomatoes (Florida only), and peppers are insurable under the Dollar Plan of Insurance.</p>
<p style="color:firebrick" ><b>E</b></p>
<p><b>Enterprise diversification.</b>  Diversification is a way to generate income from different crops and/or livestock activities that are not closely related in price, so that low income from some activities would likely be offset by higher income from others.</p>
<p style="color:firebrick" ><b>F</b></p>
<p><b>Fixed Dollar Plan of Insurance. </b> The Fixed Dollar Plan of Insurance provides protection against declining revenues due to damage that causes a loss of yield and there is no price increase in the market. The pilot Chile Pepper program is based on the Fixed Dollar Plan of Insurance and is available in Cochise County, Arizona, and in Hidalgo and Luna Counties, New Mexico.</p>
<p><b>Forward contract.</b>  This is an agreement between two parties (such as you and someone who buys your products) that calls for delivery of, and payment for, a specified quality and quantity of a commodity (such as a particular crop) at a specified future date. The price may be agreed upon in advance, or determined by formula at the time of delivery or other point in time. </p>
<p><b>Forward pricing.</b>  This is when you agree on a price or a pricing formula for a commodity that will be delivered at a later date. “Forward pricing” is used broadly here to refer to both hedging with futures or options, and forward contracting. </p>
<p><b>Futures contract.</b>  This is an agreement to buy or sell a commodity of a standardized amount and quality during a specific month in the future, under terms established by the futures exchange, at a price established in the trading pit at the commodity futures exchange. </p>
<p><b>Futures option contract.</b>  This is a contract that gives the holder the right, though not the obligation, to buy or sell a futures contract at a specific price within a specified period of time, regardless of the market price of the futures contract when the option is exercised. Options provide protection against adverse price movements.</p>
<p style="color:firebrick" ><b>G</b></p>
<p><b>Group Risk Income Protection (GRIP).</b>  GRIP is based on the experience of the county rather than on individual farms, so APH is not required for this program. A GRIP policy includes coverage against potential loss of revenue resulting from a significant reduction in your county’s yield or the commodity price of a specific crop.</p>
<p><b>Group Risk Plan (GRP).</b>  Like GRIP, GRP coverage is based on the experience of the county rather than on individual farms, so APH is not required for this program. GRP protects you in the event that your county’s average per-acre yield or payment falls below your trigger yield. </p>
<p><b>Guarantee.</b>  Also called “yield guarantee” or “insurance guarantee”, this is a promise of payment. In this context, it means the amount of money you will be paid in the event of a loss, according to the terms of your crop insurance contract. </p>
<p style="color:firebrick" ><b>H</b></p>
<p><b>Hedging.</b>  Hedging uses futures or options contracts to reduce the risk of adverse price changes prior to an anticipated cash sale or purchase of a commodity.</p>
<p style="color:firebrick" ><b>I</b></p>
<p><b>Income Protection (IP).</b>  IP is a revenue product that, based on your APH, protects you against a loss of income when prices and/or yields fall. While IP is similar to CRC, it does not have the increasing price function of CRC. </p>
<p><b>Indemnity.</b>  This is the compensation, or money you receive for qualifying losses paid under an insurance policy. The indemnity compensates for losses that exceed the deductible, up to the level of the insurance guarantee.</p>
<p style="color:firebrick" ><b>L</b></p>
<p><b>Leverage.</b>  Financial leverage refers to the use of borrowed funds to help finance a farm business. Higher levels of debt, relative to net worth, are generally considered riskier. The optimal amount of leverage depends on several factors, including farm profitability, the cost of credit, tolerance for risk, and the degree of uncertainty in income. </p>
<p><b>Liquidity.</b>  Liquidity refers to your ability to generate cash quickly and efficiently in order to meet financial obligations. Liquidity can be enhanced by holding cash, stored commodities, or other assets that can be converted to cash on short notice without incurring a major loss. </p>
<p><b>Loan Deficiency Payments (LDPs).</b>  These payments protect producers of several major commodities against revenue losses due to low prices.</p>
<p style="color:firebrick" ><b>M</b></p>
<p><b>Marketing contract.</b>  This is a contract between you and a processor or handler that establishes a marketing outlet and a price (or a formula for determining the price) for a commodity before harvest or before the commodity is ready to be marketed. </p>
<p><b>Multiple Peril Crop Insurance (MPCI).</b>  MPCI was established in the 1930s to cover yield losses from most natural causes. MPCI operated on a somewhat limited basis up through the early 1980s, when a private/public partnership was established. At that point, insurance availability was greatly expanded and premium subsidies increased in hopes of replacing the disaster payment program. Major reforms legislated in 1994—introduction of a low-cost CAT (catastrophic) coverage level, increased premium subsidies, and a requirement that participants in other farm programs obtain crop insurance—increased participation to over 200 million acres, covering the majority of acres of major field crops planted in the United States.</p>
<p style="color:firebrick" ><b>N</b></p>
<p><b>Non-Insured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP).</b>  Crop insurance is not available for all commodities. NAP provides financial assistance to producers of many of these commodities if they experience a qualifying yield loss.</p>
<p style="color:firebrick" ><b>P</b></p>
<p><b>Premium.</b>  The amount of money you pay for risk protection. Option buyers pay a premium to option sellers for an options contract. Similarly, the person who buys an insurance policy pays a premium in order to obtain coverage. </p>
<p><b>Production contract.</b>  An agreement between you and a processor that usually details the production inputs supplied by both you and the processor, the quality and quantity of a particular commodity that is to be delivered, and compensation that you will be paid. In return for giving up control over decision making, you are often compensated with a price premium or lower market risk</p>
<p style="color:firebrick" ><b>R</b></p>
<p><b>Revenue Assurance (RA).</b> Revenue Assurance provides coverage to protect you against loss of revenue caused by low prices, low yields, or a combination of both.</p>
<p><b>Reinsurance.</b>  A method of transferring some of an insurer’s risk to other parties. In the case of Federal crop insurance, USDA’s Risk Management Agency shares the risk of loss with private insurance companies that deliver policies to producers. Private reinsurance also exists. In this case, a private reinsurer assumes responsibility for a share of the risk, in return for a share of the premiums. </p>
<p><b>Revenue insurance.</b>  Revenue insurance, a cousin to MPCI, was introduced after the 1994 reforms and has become the most popular form of insurance in some areas. Whereas crop insurance covers only yield losses, revenue insurance pays when gross revenue (yield times price) falls below a specified level. These programs are subsidized and reinsured by the Risk Management Agency. </p>
<p><b>Risk.</b>  Uncertainty about outcomes that are not equally desirable. Risk is an important aspect of the farming business. The uncertainties of weather, yields, prices, government policies, global markets, and other factors can cause wide swings in farm income. Risk management involves choosing among alternatives that reduce the financial effects of such uncertainties.</p>
<p style="color:firebrick" ><b>S</b></p>
<p><b>Subsidy.</b> Money given by the government to help producers function</p>
