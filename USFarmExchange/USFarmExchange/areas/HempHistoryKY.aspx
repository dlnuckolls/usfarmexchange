                <h1>HISTORY OF HEMP IN KENTUCKY</h1>
                <hr />
                <hr />
                <p>Farmers have been growing hemp in Kentucky since the 1700s.  In fact, Kentucky was the greatest producer of hemp in the United States during the 19th and 20th centuries, with thousands of acres of hemp in production.  From the end of the Civil War until 1912, three quarters of all hemp in the United States was produced in Kentucky.  Production reached a peak in 1917 at 18,000 acres, mostly grown in the Bluegrass region, then waned after World War I due to the rise of tobacco as the cash crop in Kentucky and foreign sources of hemp fibers and finished products were introduced.</p>
                <p>In 1943, however, a Federal program reintroduced hemp for wartime needs in Kentucky and some other states to help the efforts of World War II.  This added 52,000 acres of land in Kentucky to hemp farmers, giving the hemp industry a much-needed boon.  Unfortunately, the availability of cheap synthetic fiber after World War II discouraged farmers from growing hemp, and left the farmers without a market for their crop and no reason to continue production.  By 1944, only 23 Kentucky farmers received licenses to grow hemp, and in 1945, production had ceased across the state and country.</p>
                <p>Federal policies, tightened by the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, virtually banned the production of industrial hemp during the War on Drugs.  The DEA refused to issue permits for legal hemp cultivation and held that, since industrial hemp is from the same species plant as prohibited cannabis (despite its being of lower THC yield), both were prohibited under the Controlled Substances Act.  To the Federal government, hemp was just as illegal as marijuana and all cannabis sativa – whether grown to ease chronic pain, get stoned or make rope – was a Schedule I controlled substance.</p>
                <p>By the late 20th century, consumer demand for hemp products was resurgent, but American farmers were left as bystanders.  Imported agricultural products were allowed from other countries, including Canada, but growing hemp legally was not possible in the United States.  In 1994, Kentucky was one of the first states to consider reintroducing hemp cultivation, with a commission convened by then-governor Brereton Jones to investigate legal pathways to do so.  Agricultural hemp was finally allowed by law under the Agricultural Act of 2014.</p>
                <p>Federal law under the Agricultural Act of 2014 allowed research back into hemp.  Kentucky began production again with 33 acres in 2014.  During the 2016 harvest season, only two U.S. states other than Kentucky had over 100 acres in hemp production – Colorado and Tennessee.  The first 500-acre commercial crop was planted in Harrison County in 2017, and research permits were issued for over 12,000 acres that year.</p>
                <p>While the 2014 Farm Bill was a great step in the right direction for Kentucky hemp farmers, the 2018 Farm Bill took it even a step further.  The 2018 Farm Bill made the production of hemp as an agricultural commodity legal while also removing it from the list of controlled substances altogether.  It also lists hemp as a covered commodity under crop insurance and directed the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation board to work to develop hemp policies.</p>
                <p>The future of the hemp industry in Kentucky is bright once again, and the hemp farmers can continue on in their heritage of providing our nation with this extremely versatile and useful plant – legally – and for the benefit of everyone.</p>
